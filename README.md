3 Periods, 2 Stars, 1 Age

Looking through the *Kepler* [eclipsing binaries](http://keplerebs.villanova.edu), can we find systems with starspot signals from both stars? To find these, look for 3 distinct, non-harmonic, periods.

This would give rotation periods for both components (challenge goal: figure out which period comes from which star).

Follow-up spectroscopic observation then gives masses and radii.
