That's three periods: one from the eclipses (telling us about masses and radii), and two from the starspot signals (telling us about rotation periods and magnetic activity). As a population, such systems would provide benchmarks for things like stellar evolution models and gyrochronology.\r\n\r\n## Project Team\r\n* [Andrea Chen](https://github.com/andyblueyo)\r\n* [Jim Davenport](https://github.com/jradavenport)\r\n* [Suzanne Hawley](https://github.com/adleorocks)\r\n* [John Lurie](https://github.com/jlurie)\r\n* [Michael Puig](https://github.com/mpuighol)\r\n* [Kolby Weisenburger](https://github.com/kolbylyn)\r\n\r\n \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
